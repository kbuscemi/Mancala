## Project 1 - Mancala

For thousands of years Mancala has been played around the world. Many say evidence of Mancala was first found in Ethiopia around 700 AD.
The word Mancala comes from the Arabic word naqala meaning "moved." Interesting enough the name is also referred to as a classification or type of game which,
may explain why there are almost 200 versions of mancala, played all around the world. Regardless of where you are this game can be played literally 
anywhere whether you have a mancala board or not!

## Getting Started: 

You can play the game here: Rehttps://kbuscemi.github.io/Mancala/

## Next Steps:
Ideally I would like to reverse the placement of Player 1 and Player 2's score count so each one is above their respective mancala's. It would 
not only be more astheically pleasing but the users won't be confused when checking their scores. One feature I'd love to add is to make my game page 
responsive so the game can be played on any screen size. Perhaps someone wants to play the game while watching a show - they could split their screens 
and the game layout wouldn't be affected by the smaller screen size.
